# LinkedIn Jobs Blocklist
Blocklist companies from showing up on LinkedIn Jobs. 

This Chrome userscript filters results on LinkedIn Jobs by removing companies which you do not want to see. This is incredibly useful for blocking recruiting agencies.

## Getting Started

You will need to install the TamperMonkey browser extension.

For [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
For [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

Then add the script into the extension.

## Adding to the Blocklist

To add companies to the blocklist modify the entries for the blocklist variable at the top of the script.
