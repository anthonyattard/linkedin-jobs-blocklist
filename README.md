# LinkedIn Jobs Blacklist
Blacklist companies from showing up on LinkedIn Jobs. 

This Chrome userscript filters results on LinkedIn Jobs by removing companies which you do not want to see. This is incredibly useful for blocking recruiting agencies.

## Getting Started

You will need to install the TamperMonkey browser extension.

For [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
For [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

Then add the script into the extension.

## Adding to the Blacklist

To add companies to the blacklist modify the entries for the blacklist variable at the top of the script.
